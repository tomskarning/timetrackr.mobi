## Phonegap and Cordova SDK for Countly

[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics and push notifications platform. It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.

This repository includes the SDK for Phonegap and Icenium. You also need Countly server - either hosted on cloud, or installed on-premise as Community Edition or [Enterprise Edition](http://count.ly/enterprise-edition)
